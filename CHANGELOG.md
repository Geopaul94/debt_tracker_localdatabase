### ✅ Test Cases
1. **PIN Authentication**: Set a device PIN → App should authenticate properly
2. **Biometric Authentication**: Use Face ID/Touch ID/Fingerprint → Should work as before  
3. **Pattern Authentication**: Set a screen pattern → Should authenticate successfully
4. **Password Authentication**: Set a device password → Should work correctly
5. **No Security**: Remove all security → Should show appropriate error message
6. **Mixed Setup**: Devices with multiple options → Should detect and work properly

### 🚨 What Was Fixed
- ❌ **Before**: Only worked with biometric authentication
- ✅ **After**: Works with ALL authentication types
